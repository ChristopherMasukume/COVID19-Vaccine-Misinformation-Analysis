An integrated Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Network Analysis pipeline for detecting and analyzing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on Twitter. This repository contains the complete implementation for my Master's Thesis: **"Bridging the Gap: An Integrated NLP-Network Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation"**.

## üî¨ Research Overview

This research addresses a critical gap in misinformation studies by developing a comprehensive methodology that integrates:

- **ü§ñ Transformer-based NLP Classification** - Fine-tuned BERT models for misinformation detection
- **üï∏Ô∏è Network Analysis** - Diffusion patterns and community structure mapping
- **üìä Integrated Analysis** - Connecting linguistic features to diffusion behavior

### Key Finding: The Volume-Quality Paradox

Our analysis revealed a **Volume-Quality Paradox**: while misinformation dominates by volume (96.6% in our sampled discourse), reliable content demonstrates superior engagement quality with a **45% higher viral rate** (8.0% vs 5.5%).

## üèÜ Key Results

| Metric | Performance | Significance |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Classification Accuracy** | 91.44% (DistilBERT) | State-of-the-art misinformation detection |
| **Network Scale** | 10,675 nodes, 19,771 edges | Comprehensive discourse mapping |
| **Echo Chamber Effect** | Assortativity = 0.063 | Quantitative evidence of homophily |
| **Emotion-Diffusion Correlation** | r = 0.63 (p < 0.01) | Strong link between negative emotion and misinformation spread |
